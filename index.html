      <div>
        There was a time when the internet felt different‚Äîwhen it wasn‚Äôt a maze
        of dark patterns designed to manipulate your attention, when software
        was built for the user, not for the highest bidder. Back then, a browser
        was simply a tool, a window to the world, not a marketplace disguised as
        an app.<br /><br /><strong
          >Somewhere along the way, that changed.</strong
        ><br /><br />Today, browsers are riddled with engagement traps. They
        track you, sell your data, shove crypto schemes in your face, and call
        it <i>‚Äòinnovation.‚Äô</i> But real innovation isn‚Äôt about bloated AI assistants
        or endless monetization tricks. Real innovation makes life <u>simpler</u>, not
        more exhausting.
      </div>
      <div>
        I built Zen because I believe the browser should serve you. It should be
        fast, transparent, and private by design‚Äînot as a checkbox feature, but
        as a philosophy. It should get out of your way, so you can get in, do
        what you need to do, and step away from the screen without feeling
        drained.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not a corporation. I don‚Äôt have a marketing team
        crafting sleek slogans, nor a boardroom plotting engagement metrics. I‚Äôm
        just a developer who saw what was wrong and decided to fix it. Zen isn‚Äôt
        about gimmicks. It‚Äôs about respect‚Äîfor your time, your privacy, and your
        right to a better web.<br /><br />It won‚Äôt be perfect, and I won‚Äôt
        pretend to have all the answers. But with the help of a passionate
        community, I know we can build something that matters. A browser that
        doesn‚Äôt fight against you, but works <u>with you</u>.<br /><br /><br />
        <h1>There was a browser that kind of did this, Arc.</h1>
        <br />For a while, it felt like a breath of fresh air: a browser that
        challenged conventions, that cared about design, that aimed to make
        browsing feel intentional rather than chaotic. It rethought the
        interface, introduced thoughtful features, and for a moment, it seemed
        like someone finally got it.<br /><br /><strong
          >But then, things changed.</strong
        ><br /><br />The Browser Company, Arc's VC-backed creators, became ambitious, and they decided that their loyal user-base still fell short of their goals to compete with the big names like Chrome, right from the start. Thus, they announced that Arc was "good enough" and went off to work on a new AI-powered browser.<br/><br/><i>Yet, it wasn't.</i> The Windows version was a shadow of what was promised‚Äîslow, unstable, missing core features. The MacOS version was in a better state, but performance and stability gradually degraded with every update. What started as a vision for a better browser quickly became yet another company chasing after monetization, pivoting to AI gimmicks and engagement loops instead of refining the core experience. Thus, Arc was finished, before it had even reached its real potential.
      </div>
      <div>
        I won‚Äôt pretend Arc didn‚Äôt inspire me. It did. There‚Äôs a lot to admire
        in its design philosophy, in its willingness to rethink how we interact
        with the web. But inspiration isn‚Äôt imitation. I‚Äôm taking the
        good‚Äîthoughtful UX, a clean interface, a focus on user control‚Äîand
        cutting out the bad. No forced online accounts. No feature bloat
        disguised as innovation. No chasing trends just to stay relevant.<br /><br />Zen
        isn‚Äôt about maximizing engagement. It‚Äôs about minimizing friction. It‚Äôs
        about building a browser that works with you, not on you. And beyond
        that, I‚Äôm exploring my own ideas‚Äîrethinking not just how a browser
        looks, but how it feels to use. How it fits into your life without
        demanding more of your attention than necessary. While it's still in
        early development, I'm excited to share it with you, and to hear your
        thoughts on how we can make it better together.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>So, what's the plan?</h1>
        <br />Zen is still in its early stages, but it‚Äôs growing fast. I‚Äôm
        working on a roadmap that focuses on the essentials: mantain firefox updated
        and secure to gain trust, improve the UI/UX to make it more intuitive and enjoyable, and
        implement features that make your life easier, not more complicated.

        The future of Zen isn‚Äôt set in stone. It‚Äôs a work in progress, shaped by
        your feedback, your ideas, and your needs. I‚Äôm not building this browser
        for me. I‚Äôm building it for you‚Äîfor all of us who believe the web can be
        better, who want to take back control of our digital lives, and who
        refuse to settle for the status quo.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre tired of
        browsers that treat you like a product, if you‚Äôre looking for a
        different way to browse, if you believe in a web that respects your
        privacy and your time, then I invite you to join me on this journey. Let‚Äôs
        build something that matters. Let‚Äôs build a browser that respects you.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also want to invite you to contribute, if you have any ideas, suggestions
        or want to help in any way, feel free to let us know. Some zen features where completely
        community driven, implemented by external contributors. We are always looking for
        new ideas and ways to improve the browser.

          I'm not a design expert, just someone learning through building Zen. These are personal just 
          thoughts. I hope they spark reflection, especially for those in the FOSS 
          community. Read with an open mind, think beyond what I‚Äôve written, and if anything resonates or 
          you disagree, feel free to reach out. I‚Äôd love to talk more and keep on learning!<br/><br/>

          Don't worry, don't uninstall Zen inmediatedly. This isn‚Äôt about removing all customization. 
          Zen will always support mods and deeper tweaks for those who want them, just not at the cost of
          thoughtful, opinionated design.<br /><br/>

      </div>
      <div>
        A year ago, I set out to build a browser. Not just any browser, but my browser. One that would 
        reflect my values, my needs, my ideal vision of the web. I called it Zen Browser.<br/><br/>

        Like many developers, I started by dreaming big: total customization, endless tweaks, and fine-grained 
        control over every pixel. But somewhere along the way, <strong>something changed</strong>.<br/><br/>

        What I found instead was clarity, not in complexity, but in simplicity. In choosing design that respected the 
        user, instead of overwhelming them with choices.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>The Allure of Customization</strong><br/><br/>
        There‚Äôs something exciting about total freedom. Developers love the idea of giving users endless choice. 
        It feels democratic. Respectful. Open.<br/><br/>

        That‚Äôs how I started. Zen Browser was going to be fully moldable. You‚Äôd shape it to your needs, down 
        to the smallest detail.<br/><br/>

        But what I learned is that more choice doesn‚Äôt always mean a better experience. In fact, it often leads 
        to decision fatigue. Users get lost in the settings instead of enjoying the product. And many never find a 
        setup they actually love, they just keep tweaking.<br/><br/>

        At some point, I realized that no one ever said, <i>‚ÄúI love this browser because I spent three hours configuring 
        it.‚Äù</i> They just said, <i>‚ÄúIt works. It feels right.‚Äù</i>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>The Turning Point</strong><br/><br/>
        It happened with something as small as a color picker.<br/><br/>

        Zen Browser's original color picker was incredibly flexible. You could set any color, rotation, 
        gradient style, it was a playground. Total freedom. And on paper, it was a win. Users could make their browser 
        look exactly how they wanted.<br/><br/>

        But something didn‚Äôt sit right. The more I used it, the more I noticed the results often looked... off. Some color 
        combos clashed. Others lacked contrast. Gradients looked messy or chaotic. The feature was powerful, but it didn‚Äôt 
        guide anyone. It just gave them tools and walked away.<br/><br/>

        That‚Äôs when I looked at what Arc did, and I‚Äôll admit, we copied it. (<i class="text-xs">Big shock, I know.</i>)<br/><br/>

        We removed the rotation. We enforced color harmony. Gradients had to use complementary or analogous tones. The result? 
        No more wild combinations. No more chaos. Suddenly, every workspace had colors that just worked. Gradients that felt 
        designed, not generated.<br/><br/>

        Not everyone liked the change. People asked why they couldn‚Äôt tweak things the old way. <strong>They missed the freedom</strong>. But I didn‚Äôt miss it. In fact, I felt <strong>proud</strong>.<br/><br/>

        That was my turning point. When I realized I didn‚Äôt want to make something endlessly customizable. I wanted to make 
        something beautiful. Something that felt finished. Something that didn‚Äôt ask to be fixed or adjusted, it just looked good, 
        because it was designed that way.<br/><br/>

        That moment, over a simple color picker, defined everything that came next.<br/><br/>

        <span class="opacity-70 italic">Looking back, it wasn‚Äôt just about colors. It was about clarity. I realized that good design isn‚Äôt about offering every 
        option, it‚Äôs about making the right choices so the user doesn‚Äôt have to. That shift changed everything about how I approached Zen.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Finding the Sweet Spot</strong><br/><br/>

        Total rigidity can be just as limiting as total freedom. The real challenge, and the real art, is in finding the 
        balance between the two.<br/><br/>

        That‚Äôs where the idea of sensible defaults, respectful overrides came in.

        With Zen, I wanted most users to open the browser and feel like it was already finished. Clean, quiet, 
        considered. But I also wanted to leave a door open, discreet, intentional, out of the way, for those who needed more.<br/><br/>

        That‚Äôs why <strong>advanced preferences</strong> exist. Hidden settings. Power-user flags. The kind of features you don‚Äôt stumble 
        into, but deliberately reach for. Like the ability to bring back full gradient control in the color picker. 
        Or override animation timings. Or adjust tab behavior beyond the default.<br/><br/>

        These aren‚Äôt features for everyone. They‚Äôre escape hatches for those who know what they want. And keeping them 
        tucked away preserves the core experience for everyone else.<br/><br/>

        The sweet spot isn‚Äôt compromise. It‚Äôs clarity, knowing what your product stands for, while still leaving space 
        at the edges for people who ask for more.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>What I Learned</strong><br/><br/>

        This past year didn‚Äôt just teach me how to build a browser. It taught me how to think.<br/><br/>

        I used to believe that more options made a better product. That users wanted control above all else. But 
        I‚Äôve learned something deeper, people don‚Äôt open a browser to tweak. They open it to use. And the best 
        experience is the one that‚Äôs already great, before you touch a single setting.<br/><br/>

          <ul class="ml-4">
            <li><strong>Customization is not a replacement for good design.</strong> If your product only shines when users tweak it, you haven‚Äôt finished it.<br/><br/></li>
            <li><strong>Defaults matter more than features. Most people never change settings.</strong> What they see first becomes their entire experience.<br/><br/></li>
            <li><strong>Good design is opinionated, and that‚Äôs okay.</strong> You‚Äôre allowed to make decisions on behalf of the user, as long as those decisions are thoughtful and respectful.<br/><br/></li>
            <li><strong>Hidden power is better than visible clutter.</strong> Give advanced users what they need, but keep the surface calm and approachable.<br/><br/></li>
            <li><strong>Every decision sends a message.</strong> Even a toggle switch tells the user what kind of product they‚Äôre dealing with, precise and 
              focused, or chaotic and unfinished.<br/><br/></li>
          </ul>

        Zen Browser got better the moment I stopped trying to please everyone and started trying to serve someone, someone who wants clarity, not control. Someone who wants to open their browser and feel calm, not busy.</li>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>A Quiet Conclusion</strong><br/><br/>

        I‚Äôm not a design expert. I didn‚Äôt study user experience or typography or color theory. I‚Äôm just 
        someone who built a browser, made a lot of mistakes, and slowly started to see things differently.<br/><br/>

        Zen Browser isn‚Äôt perfect. It still has rough edges. There are things I‚Äôd change, and things I‚Äôm 
        still unsure about. But if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs that <strong>simplicity takes more courage 
        than complexity</strong>. It‚Äôs easier to add features than it is to say ‚Äúthis is enough.‚Äù<br/><br/>

        This past year taught me to trust the user, not by handing them the entire toolbox, but by giving 
        them something they can rely on. <strong>Something that feels considered</strong>.<br/><br/>

        If you're building something of your own, I hope you don‚Äôt feel pressure to make it do everything. 
        Maybe just focus on making it <strong>feel right</strong>. Thoughtful defaults. Strong ideas. Gentle polish. 
        That‚Äôs what people remember.<br/><br/>

        Not the number of settings. Not the sliders or toggles. Just how it made them feel. That‚Äôs the kind of design 
        I‚Äôm still learning to do. And I hope to get better at it, one <strong>release at a time</strong>.<br/><br/>

        So, if you‚Äôre building something, remember this:<br/><br/>
        <i class="ml-4 opacity-70 font-bold">
          You don‚Äôt have to please everyone. You just have to care deeply about someone.
